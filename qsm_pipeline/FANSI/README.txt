The FAst Nonlinear Susceptibility Inversion (FANSI) Toolbox was created by 
Carlos Milovic, PhD. at the Biomedical Imaging Center at Pontificia Universidad 
Catolica de Chile and the Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging at University 
College London, in 2017, in collaboration with:
Berkin Bilgic, PhD. and Bo Zhao, PhD. at Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, 
Harvard Medical School, MA, USA
Julio Acosta-Cabronero, PhD at Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, Institute 
of Neurology, University College London, London, UK, and German Center for 
Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Magdeburg, Germany
and Cristian Tejos, PhD. at Department of Electrical Engineering, Pontificia 
Universidad Catolica de Chile, Santiago, Chile and the Biomedical Imaging Center 
at Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile.

From 2020, this toolbox is being mantained and expanded at the Department of 
Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London, UK, by 
Carlos Milovic, PhD. with supervision by Prof. Karin Shmueli.

Parser code optimization and GPU implementation were made by Patrich Fuchs, PhD.



This README file corresponds to the FANSI-Toolbox v3.0, released on 2021.10.15

***  NOTE THAT SOME VARIABLES WERE RENAMED TO IMPROVE READABILITY. ***
**** BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY IS NOT GUARANTEED ****
New coding convention:
Function parameters no longer use the underscore (_) character, with the
camelCase convention strickly used. Example: tol_update -> tolUpdate
Function parameters may start with a capital letter only if they are defined 
in the Fourier domain (example: params.K the dipole kernel)
Boolean parameters (true or false) always start with "is".
Function names follow flatcase or snake_case, depending on readibility.



Source code for the Fast Nonlinear Susceptibility Inversion (FANSI) method is
provided in the root of this toolbox, along with some example scripts.
Please see the scripts to learn how to use the functions included in this 
toolbox. You may also use the "doc" and "help" commands to see the header of 
each function and learn about all the function parameters.
From release 3.0, we now include isotropic TV regularization solvers for the 
linear and nonlinear QSM functionals (wiTV and nliTV) for completeness.

The code in this toolbox is based on source code released by Berkin Bilgic at 
http://martinos.org/~berkin/software.html

While the focus of this toolbox is to provide state-of-the-art methods to perform 
the dipole inversion step in quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM), we have 
included code to perform tasks throughout the QSM pipeline for completeness and 
for academic and research purposes. Source code for other methods that extend the 
scope of the toolbox is included in different folders, organized into categories, 
as described below:

+ AnalyticModels: This folder contains code to create spheres and cylinders, and 
        simulate the magnetization field that they create. For spheres, there are 
        two functions that mimic the MRI acquisition by calculating intra-voxel 
        dephasing effects. Please cite: Marques JPP, Bowtell R. Application of a

+ BackgroundFieldRemoval: Files in this folder include a function to fit a 
        polynomial to the data inside a region of interest (ROI), a function to 
        generate the magnetization field given all air-tissue interfaces, and a 
        mask to fit a background model with additional linear gradients to the 
        phase data via least squared minimization.

+ Inversion: Algorithms that perform the final dipole inversion step in the QSM 
        pipeline, starting with an estimate of the local magnetization fields. 
        This folder contains the following folders and methods:

+ Metrics: Compute different global quality/error metrics to compare reconstructed 
        maps with known ground-truths. The functions used to calculate quality 
        metrics are based on the source code provided at the 4th International 
        Workshop on MRI Phase Contrast & Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping, 
        September 26th - 28th 2016, at Medical University of Graz, Austria, for 
        its QSM Challenge. http://www.neuroimaging.at/pages/qsm.php

        2020;85:1624-1637 doi: 10.1002/mrm.28185

+ MultiechoFit: Nonlinear methods to estimate the field map and phase offset 
        from multiecho GRE acquisitions. Regularization terms are imposed on the 
        phase offset to reduce noise.

+ OptParams: This code is for analyzing and visualizing the L-curve and for 
        Frequency Analysis methods to find optimal reconstruction parameters 
        (alpha1 in TV based reconstructions). Please cite: 
        Milovic C, Prieto C, Bilgic B, Uribe S, Acosta-Cabronero J, Irarrazaval P, 
        Tejos C. Comparison of Parameter Optimization Methods for Quantitative 
        Susceptibility Mapping. Magn Reson Med. 2020. DOI: 10.1002/MRM.28435 

+ Relaxometry: This code is to estimate the initial magnetization and relaxation 
        time (T2/T2*) from MRI acquisitions. We provide a simple log fitting 
        funtion and nonlinear regularized functions. Regularization is done 
        explicitly on the relaxometry parameters, or implicitly on the projection 
        of the relaxometry parameters onto each simulated acquisition, for all
        echo times (see echoes suffix). These functions are designed for 3D data 
        acquired at multiple echo times only.

+ Unwrapping: We include both the analytic approximation and iterative methods 
        proposed by Schofield, M . Fast phase unwrapping algorithm for 
        interferometric applications. Opt Lett. 2003;28(14):1194-6 to perform 
        Laplacian-based unwrapping. We also include a Laplacian-based alternative, 
        where the gradient of the image is calculated with different phase offsets, 
        to create different wrapping artifacts, and a Poisson equation is solved 
        to find an optimal solution. Finally, an iterative implementation imposes 
        nonlinear data-fidelity on the acquired phase to avoid removing harmonic 
        components (similar to the PCG-Laplacian method, Robinson et al. 
        NMR Biomed 2016  DOI: 10.1002/nbm.3601). 
        Please refer to each file header for more details.
 


We provide an analytic Susceptibility brain phantom (data phantom folder) based 
on the phantom developed by C Langkammer, et al NeuroImage 2015. 
doi: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.02.041, and C. Wisnieff, et al NeuroImage 2014 
doi: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.12.050. 
Please cite our work (doi: 10.1002/mrm.27073) and theirs if you use this phantom.
 

Sample data from the 2016 QSM Reconstruction Challenge is also provided in a 
separate folder (data_challenge). In addition to the original single-orientation 
acquisition, COSMOS and X33 ground truths, we provide the X12 and X13 anisotropic 
components and a mask that estimates external non-tissue areas. If you use this 
dataset, please cite:
